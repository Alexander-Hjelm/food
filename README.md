## Summary

Here is a recipe collection written and tested under torture-like conditions by wannabe culinary students with too little or too much free time. You are most welcome to fork 🍴 (haha get it?) this repository and make a pull request.

The recipes in this collection have been collected and curated (mostly) by [Alexander](https://github.com/alexander-hjelm) from the following sources:

- His tripped-out travels and travails in Sweden and other countries.
- His various ex-girlfriends
- His current [girlfriend](https://github.com/LuciferinW) (don't expect to find much on her GitHub profile though)
- His cat
- His dog
- His [CatDog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CatDog)
- His [cyborg turtle](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-b-plus/)

## History

Originally this repository started out as a fork 🍴 of [Olof Sjödin's](https://github.com/olofsjod) repository, which can no longer be found on his public GitHub account for reasons™.
