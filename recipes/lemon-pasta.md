2. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions.
3. Add the frozen green beans to the pasta during the last 3–4 minutes of cooking.
4. While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a pan and sauté the garlic and spring onions until fragrant and slightly softened.
5. Drain the pasta and beans, reserving a little of the cooking water.
6. Add the pasta and beans to the pan with the garlic and onions, along with a splash of the reserved cooking water to create a light sauce.
7. Season with lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and chili flakes.
8. Stir in the chopped walnuts just before serving for a crunchy, nutty finish.
