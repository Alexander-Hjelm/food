## Instructions

1. Press the tofu if needed, then cut it into even cubes and thread onto skewers.  
2. Prepare the satay sauce: blend or mix garlic, ginger, peanuts, soy sauce, lime juice, syrup, turmeric, coconut milk, and sriracha until creamy.  
3. Scoop out a small portion of the sauce to use as a marinade. Coat the tofu skewers lightly and let them rest for at least 10 minutes.  
4. Heat a grill pan or regular pan over medium heat and cook the tofu skewers until golden on all sides.  
5. Warm the remaining peanut sauce in a small pot, stirring gently until smooth.  
6. Serve skewers with rice, drizzle with extra sauce, and top with fresh coriander and lime wedges.
