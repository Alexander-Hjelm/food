## Instructions

1. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, flour, and a little water until smooth.  
2. Add sliced spring onions, salt, and pepper. Mix gently.  
3. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and pour in the egg mixture.  
4. Cook until the edges start to set, then gently lift edges to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath.  
5. Once mostly set, carefully flip the omelette and cook briefly on the other side.  
6. Serve hot, plain or with additional toppings of choice.
