# How to: Muesli

> Hoooooooooooooooo! This one sure is a story. Once upon a time, **Alexander** discovered that he could save serious bucks by buying the ingredients and **mixing his own muesli**. Since then he has never ever eaten anything else for breakfast (it is true, ask him!). He is also now comfortably retired on Madeira and enjoying the infinitely compounding interest of his muesli money. I mean where a coffee is just 1.20€, who can complain? I don't!
