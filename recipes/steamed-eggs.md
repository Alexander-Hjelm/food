## Instructions

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk gently until smooth, avoiding too many bubbles.
2. Add 80–120 ml of water (roughly one-third to one-half cup) and a pinch of salt. Mix until well combined.
3. Pour the mixture into a heat-safe bowl.
4. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and pierce a few small holes in the top to allow steam to escape.
5. Steam for about **15 minutes**, or until the eggs are set with a silky, custard-like texture.
6. Remove the bowl from the steamer and uncover carefully.
7. Top with a drizzle of light soy sauce, a few drops of sesame oil, and chopped spring onions.  
   Add seafood or soy beans if desired.
8. Serve warm.
