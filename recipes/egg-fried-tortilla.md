## Instructions

1. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, sliced spring onions, salt, and pepper.
2. Heat a pan over low heat and pour in the egg mixture.
3. When the eggs begin to set but are still soft on top, place the tortilla directly onto the eggs and gently press.
4. Continue frying until the egg is fully cooked and has attached to the tortilla.
5. Flip the whole tortilla-egg layer so the tortilla faces down.
6. Add any desired stuffing (cheese, veggies, leftovers—go wild).
7. Fold or roll, then serve warm.
