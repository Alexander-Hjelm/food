1. Cook the red beans until soft, then mash them into a smooth paste.
2. Heat the mashed beans with a little oil and syrup or sugar until combined; set aside to cool.
3. Prepare the yeast according to package instructions.
4. Mix the yeast with the flour and knead into a smooth dough. Let it rest in a warm place until it doubles in size.
5. Once the dough has risen, divide it into small portions.
6. Flatten each portion into a small bowl shape, fill with the red bean paste, and seal to form little buns.
7. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and cook the buns without oil, turning occasionally to brown all sides.
8. Serve warm as a sweet snack or breakfast treat.
